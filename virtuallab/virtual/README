To Run the program:

>make
>cp example1/* .
>./virtual 0x333
TLB MISS
PAGE FAULT
>
Explaination of files:

virtual.cpp
  The main code file for the program
  all work on the assignment should be done in
  this file

constants.cpp/constants.h
  Contain specifications for the page table and tlb
  These are in sperate file so the code in virtual.cpp
  can be testing on multiple page table/tlb arrangments

example1/
  Contains basic constants files for the problems from
  the textbook

example2/
  Contains a different example. This example has different
  sizes for everything so the virtual address translation
  code must be generic and work for any sizes

example3/
  another different example

autograde.sh
  runs some autograding and searches the program output
  for the correct physical address and MISS/HIT/PAGE FAULT
  to use:
  ./autograde.sh

Makefile
  used by make to compile the program
